In my code, I have five functions, the first function that's called is getLearnerData which calls all other functions and is intalizied by result, two functions I have called checkCourse and checkPossiblePoints, both of them check for error cases that would mess up the code. After checking error cases, I run the function createLearnerID, through this I seperate the data given to me  in LearnerSubmissions and organize it better where all the subbmited assignment would fall under one id if it's the same throughout. After organizing the data, I call the function learnersGrade which does all the calculations for me to find out the students grade and if it's due or pass due date. At the end of the function, it returns the values which goes into the variable result and then I print it all out.
